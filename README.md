# Leave Management System - SOLID and Clean Architecture

This project showcases Clean Architecture in .NET Core and focuses on creating a modular, testable, and maintainable application in .NET Core.
## Overview

Creating a solid foundation for a .NET Core application requires careful architecture to ensure maintainability and testability. Adopting SOLID principles ensures code quality, facilitates agile development, and mitigates code smells. SOLID stands for:

- S - Single-Responsibility Principle
-  O - Open-closed Principle
- L - Liskov Substitution Principle
- I - Interface Segregation Principle
- D - Dependency Inversion Principle
